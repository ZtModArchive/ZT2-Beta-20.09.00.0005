         MSPA officials have found conditions in the Waltham Animal Park to be in violation of animal 
         welfare standards. Exhibits are filthy, animals are underfed and in environments not completely suited
         to their needs, and trash litters the public common areas. They have mandated that the park be closed. 
         <p/>
         The Blue Fang Development Fund has acquired $5000 to contribute to the redevelopment and future 
         growth of the site. MSPA concedes that improving conditions is in the best interests of the 
         animals and has given you the following agenda. Hire maintenance staff to clean the park and zookeepers 
         to address the exhibits. Ensure that the basic needs of the animals currently in the park are met. Once you 
         have achieved these objectives, MSPA will review your efforts.
