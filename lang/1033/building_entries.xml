               <p/>
	       Since you can earn money for your recycling efforts, including a compost building in your zoo can be a 
	       smart economic move. Due to the aromatic nature of the compost building, it's best to place it in a remote 
	       corner of your zoo where it won't offend your guests.

               The sushi stand, which features raw fish and rice, provides guests with a gourmet food option. Gourmet 
               foods like sushi cost more than some of the other dining options, but adult female guests appreciate and are willing to pay for fancier foods.
