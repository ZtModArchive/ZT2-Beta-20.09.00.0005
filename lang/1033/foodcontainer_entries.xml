            The dead bodies of whole animals, including fur, skin, and bones, are often fed to 
            carnivorous animals which enjoy the challenging of having to work to "unwrap" their meal to 
            find the best parts.
	    <p/>
	    Artificially-built animal carcasses are used as "containers" for feeding large chunks of 
	    meat or fish to carnivores.  Guests enjoy watching the animals eat from these more 
	    interesting containers.

            A browse holder is an 8-10 ft. pole with a container on top that is designed to hold 
            grass, hay, and large, leafy tree branches. The positioning of food in this high location 
            encourages

               An elevated food dish enables taller animals, like giraffes, to reach their food more 
               easily. 
	       Since animals can eat from it while standing, an elevated food dish 
	       also aids digestion in many four-legged animals.

               A food dish is an all-purpose food and water container that can serve the needs of 
               all types of animals and dietary choices. A food dish cannot accommodate as many animals
               as a trough and will need to be refilled more often.

               A food trough is a large all-purpose food and water container that can accommodate
