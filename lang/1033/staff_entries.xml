            The role of an educator is to walk around and talk to your guests, educating them about the 
            animals in your zoo. Animal educators increase your guests’ enjoyment of your zoo by providing 
            interesting information about the animals they are currently viewing.
	    <p/>
	    You can assign animal educators to specific podiums that you’ve purchased and placed in 
	    different locations in your zoo. Once assigned, the animal educator will speak at the podium 
	    periodically about nearby exhibits.
	    <p/>
	    If they are not assigned to an educator podium or they can’t find one, most animal educators 
	    will seek out the staff center. If they can’t find a staff center, they will wander the zoo 
	    spouting interesting animal facts to nearby guests.
	    <p/>
	    Animal educators receive a salary, which is deducted from your zoo account on the first of 
	    each month. Keep in mind, though, that they can also help increase the amount of donations 
	    you receive from happy guests who enjoyed being both entertained and educated during their 
	    visit to your zoo.
