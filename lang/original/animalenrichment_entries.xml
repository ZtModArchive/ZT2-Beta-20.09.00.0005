            Apples are a healthy part of many animalsâ€™ diets, and they have the extra advantage of being 
            almost as much fun to play with as a ball.
	    <p/>
	    They can also be hidden in containers or on the ground to encourage foraging and exploring 
	    behavior in animals.

            A beef shank is a big treat for most carnivores; they enjoy ripping and tearing into a big 
            solid chunk of meat and bone. It should be considered a supplemental dietary item, as most 
            animals could not survive on a diet of beef shanks alone.
	    <p/>
	    A beef shank can also be hidden in a container or on the ground to encourage animals to 
	    forage and explore.
