      <overview>
         A group of African elephants were scheduled to be culled in the Kingdom of Swaziland because of 
         elephant overpopulation. Instead they have been offered to the zoo best able to create a suitable 
         habitat for the animals. One crated African elephant has been delivered to your zoo and can be found
         near the front gate.  
         <p/>
         Create a wildlife exhibit for the elephant and ensure that its basic needs are met. 
         If you can demonstrate your ability to care for this species, you will be given 3 more animals of mixed 
         gender to help you establish a thriving community.

         The Kingdom of Swaziland is pleased to be able to offer you the remaining African elephants. The 
         animals will be delivered shortly for you to incorporate into your African elephant exhibit.  The 
         habitat conditions will be monitored by the International Society of Animal Wellbeing (ISAW) for the 
         next 3 months and should you fail to meet the basic needs for any of these animals, they will be removed 
         from your zoo and donated to another facility.

      <Crueloverview>
         An unnamed zoo in North America has been operating in an unregulated and 
         uncontrolled environment. A series of animal abuse complaints brought against 
         the facility have initiated an official investigation. The animals were found 
         in poorly designed and poorly maintained facilities that did not provide for the 
         health and psychological well-being of the animals. These mistreated animals need 
         rehabilitative care.
         <p/>
         Although your facility has so far only catered to small animals, you are one of the few
	 in the area with vacant land. Due to the emergency nature of the situation, yours is the
	 only facility capable of accommodating these animals. 
	 <p/>
	 A herd of zebras and a pride of lions have been delivered to your zoo. Create 
	 exhibits large enough to accommodate these 2 animal groups, treat their illnesses 
	 and provide basic care.

      <SmugglingRingoverview>
         Authorities have exposed an international smuggling ring that was illegally trading 
         endangered animals. Many animals have been recovered in recent raids and are 
         desperate for suitable homes. You have been given the opportunity to obtain several 
         endangered animals as long as you can quickly prepare exhibits that will house them 
         successfully. You will receive a new animal at a regular interval for as 
         long as you can maintain the happiness and welfare of the animals you have previously 
         received.  Further shipments of animals will cease on first report that any animal 
         previously sent to your facility becomes unhappy with its care or environment.

        Each of the animals you have received were confiscated from a smuggling operation and had 
        likely been poached from game reserves, many of them having been separated from their 
        mothers while very young. It would be an incredible accomplishment to be able to return 
        these animals to the wild. Meet the advanced needs of these animals so that they may be
        successfully released back into their natural habitats.
