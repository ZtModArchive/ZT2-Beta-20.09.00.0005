   		Your local city council and animal welfare society want to run a promotion at your zoo granting 
   		residents of your community half price admissions.  They hope to deliver the message that proper 
   		care and feeding is essential to all animals, and that domestic animals deserve the same attention 
   		as the exotic animals in your zoo.  They have agreed to pay you an upfront fee of $5000.  This 
   		promotion will last for 6 months as long as your animals remain healthy.  If any of your animals 
   		become ill, the promotion will end immediately and no further compensation will be received.  At the 
   		end of the promotion period, if no animals became ill, they will also compensate you for your lost 
   		admissions fees.

   	<CHAnimalTrade>
   		The Zoological Cooperative Association (ZCA) is running a feasibility study to determine if 
   		member zoos can benefit from a program of trading animals between zoos.  Ideally zoos would 
   		exchange animals with similar biome requirements however availability won't always accommodate 
   		this. As a member, you will exchange one of your animals for a new animal for a temporary 3 
   		month period.  It is essential that you keep the animal healthy and achieve a donation 
   		income of $500 for your new animal over this period otherwise the venture will be financially 
   		unsuccessful.  In 3 months you will again swap animals.  The study will determine if a regularly 
   		rotating exhibit cycle has a positive impact on zoo attendance and cash flow.

   		Unfortunately the anonymous donor did not accurately represent the facts. While 
   		you have received a healthy animal, it is not in the endangered class as was
