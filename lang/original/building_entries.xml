               The cheesecake cart offers a tasty, filling dessert that is particularly popular 
               with adult male guests. Guests often look for dessert after eating other foods so it's 
               a good idea to place the cheesecake cart near other food stands.

               A compost building in your zoo is the repository for all of the garbage, compost, and recyclable items 
               collected by you and your zoo staff.
               <p/>
	       Since you can earn money for your recycling efforts, including a compost building in your zoo can be a 
	       smart economic move. Due to the aromatic nature of the compost building, it's best to place it in a remote 
	       corner of your zoo where it won't offend your guests.

               Family restrooms are larger and cost more than small restrooms, but they accommodate more guests. Guests who
               don't have to stand in line for the small bathroom can spend their time viewing animals and enjoying your
               zoo's more entertaining amenities.

               The front gate is the main entrance to your zoo. Every guest who visits your zoo will pass through the 
               front gate (and pay admission!). It is a good idea to leave plenty of open space around this main entry 
               point to allow your guests to come and go easily.
               <p/>
               Clicking on the front gate will open the Zoo Status panel where you can review information about your zoo's 
               performance.

               The gift shop, which offers gifts and souvenirs at a wide range of prices, can accommodate multiple 
               guests at a time. Guests particularly enjoy purchasing a souvenier when they've had a great experience 
               in your zoo, and their purchases can do a lot to help your zoo's bottom line.

               foods like sushi cost more than some of the other dining options, but adult female guests appreciate and are willing to pay for fancier foods.
