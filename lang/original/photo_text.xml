		Your local city council and animal welfare society want to run a promotion at your zoo granting 
		residents of your community half price admissions.  They hope to deliver the message that proper 
		care and feeding is essential to all animals, and that domestic animals deserve the same attention 
		as the exotic animals in your zoo.  They have agreed to pay you an upfront fee of $5000.  This 
		promotion will last for 6 months as long as your animals remain healthy.  If any of your animals 
		become ill, the promotion will end immediately and no further compensation will be received.  At the 
		end of the promotion period, if no animals became ill, they will also compensate you for your lost 
   		admissions fees.
