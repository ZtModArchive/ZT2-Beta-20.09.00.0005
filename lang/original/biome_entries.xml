         Woodland characterized by lush vegetation and comparatively high temperature and rainfall throughout the year. Rain forests are the world's most biologically diverse ecosystems. Although they account for less than 7 percent of the land surface on Earth, they contain more than 50 percent-some scientists estimate as high as 90 percent-of its plant and animal species. One hectare (about 2.5 acres) of tropical rain forest may contain more than 600 species of trees. By comparison, the forests of the United States and Canada combined contain only around 700 tree species. Even more impressive are the number and diversity of animal species that call rain forests their home. One study found more species of ants living on a single rain forest stump than exist in all of the British Isl

         Rain forests also play a critical role in global climate regulation by absorbing carbon dioxide, a gas believed to be partially responsible for global warming. Plants naturally absorb carbon dioxide and give off oxygen gas in the process of photosynthesis, and tropical rain forests absorb more carbon dioxide than any other terrestrial ecosystem on earth.

          There is general agreement among the scientific community that by absorbing some of the gas, rain forests play a vital role in lessening its impact.

         To be classified as a rain forest, a forest must have a closed canopy, in which the treetops, or crowns, touch each other, creating a shaded forest interior. In addition, temperature and rainfall must be high and relatively even throughout the year. Forests that meet these criteria are found flanking the equator in South and Central America, Asia, Africa, and Australia. In South America, a vast, forested area of the Amazon River basin in Brazil and neighboring countries is by far the largest rain forest in the world. It encompasses more than 3.5 million sq km (about 1.4 million sq mi)-about half of the total global rain forest cover. The larger of two large rain forests in Asia is centered along the Malay Archipelago, including the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, and the Republic of the Philippines. The other main rain forest in Asia is found primarily on the island of New Guinea and in northern Australia. In Africa, most of the rain forest is concentrated along the Atlantic coast and the Congo River

         is a tropical grassland with a scattering of shrubs and small and large trees. Savannahs may result from soil conditions, from periodic fires caused by lightning or set by humans, or from climatic influences.

         Climatically determined savannahs, as found in western and southwestern Africa, develop in regions with marked wet and dry seasons, where rainfall ranges between 100 and 400 mm (4 and 16 in) a year. These savannahs vary from open-canopied forests with a grassy understory to true savannahs in which grasses are dominant. When the rainfall is 100 to 200 mm (4 to 8 in), generally only grasses can survive the dry season. When rainfall reaches 300 mm (12 in), the soil holds enough water to sustain shrubs through the dry season as well. When rainfall exceeds 300 mm, enough water is left to support solitary trees; and when rainfall exceeds 400 mm, enough moisture remains during the dry season to allow trees to grow more densely and to form a canopy, shading out the grasses

      <page2>
         
         In regions of higher rainfall, such as eastern Africa, savannahs vegetation is maintained by periodic fires. Consuming dry grass at the end of the rainy season, the fires burn back the forest vegetation, check the invasion of trees and shrubs, and stimulate new grass growth. These savannahs are also influenced by large grazing mammals such as wildebeest and zebra. When abundant, the animals can so reduce the vegetation that the grassy cover cannot carry a fire. Woody vegetation then increases, changing savannahs to woodland. Such woody growth can be reduced, in turn, by large browsers such as elephants

         Soil-determined savannahs include the llanos of Venezuela and the campos cerrados of Brazil. The latter are characterized by a hard crust in the soil, formed by ferric oxides. Grasses grow in the soil above the crust; trees grow where roots, following cracks in the crust, can reach deeper groundwater.

            The Alpine biome, similar to the tundra biome, is found in high mountain areas around the 
            world. Harsh conditions cause vegetation to grow low to the ground in alpine meadows.
	    <p/>
	    Tundra is the treeless plain that lies north of the northern coniferous forests and on the 
	    Antarctic Peninsula in the southern hemisphere. 
	    <p/>
	    Trees cannot survive in this biome because of the cold temperatures, high winds, and heavy 
	    snowfall, as well as the permafrost, a layer of permanently frozen subsoil. Plant life tends 
	    to grow low to the ground. In the summer, large numbers of birds migrate to the tundra to feed 
	    on insects. Other animals found in this area include reindeer, wolves, fox, voles, and lemmings.

         <p/>               
             The boreal forest biome, which consists of a great band of evergreen conifer forests, extends 
             around the Northern Hemisphere in the subarctic latitudes. Within this zone, the growing 
             season is brief and the winter is long and cold. These circumstances exclude most broadleaf 
             deciduous trees, which require more time to regrow their leaves than the subarctic climate 
             provides. Evergreen trees, on the other hand, are ready to resume photosynthesis whenever the 
             air grows mild enough. Furthermore, the compact, cylindrical shape and waxy skin of the 
             needlelike leaves retard moisture loss during the winter, when environmental water is 
             unavailable because it is frozen.
	     <p/>
	     Compared with the forests of lower latitudes, the boreal forests - often called by their 
	     Russian name of taiga - are rather uniform in structure and species composition. Trees, often 
	     in dense stands of even age, dominate. Many assume a narrow, pointed habit that permits snow 
	     to be shed readily. Ground vegetation within the shady forest is sparse, comprising low 
	     shrubs, many of them in the heath family, and a layer of mosses. Another conspicuous feature 
	     of the taiga region, from which the ice sheets retreated only about 10,000 years ago, is the 
	     countless ponds and bogs that pock the flat and poorly drained terrain.
	     <p/>
	     In Eurasia, the taiga spans the continent from the Russian Far East to Scandinavia. The 
	     westernmost forests are very monotonous, but the number of species rises as one moves to 
	     the east, and the forests of Hokkaido in northern Japan are comparatively diverse. An 
	     exception to the evergreen character of most of the taiga is the deciduous larch forests 
	     of eastern Siberia, where the bitterly cold winters of the continental interior make the 
	     retention of any leaves, even needles, a liability.
	     <p/>
	     The boreal forests of North America are richer in species than their Eurasian counterparts 
	     but are in other ways similar. Because of the north-south alignment of North American 
	     mountain ranges, taigalike conifer forests extend far into the temperate zone along the 
	     spines of the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada, the Rocky Mountains, and the Appalachians.

               Desert is a term applied to regions of the earth that are characterized by less than 
               254 mm (10 in) of annual rainfall, an evaporation rate that exceeds precipitation, and, 
               in most cases, a high average temperature. Because of a lack of moisture in the soil and 
               low humidity in the atmosphere, most of the sunlight penetrates to the ground. Daytime 
               temperatures can reach 55° F (131° C) in the shade. At night the desert floor radiates 
               heat back to the atmosphere, and the temperature can drop to near freezing.
	       <p/>
	       Most deserts arise due to atmospheric wind conditions. Warm air masses created two belts 
	       of desert, one along the Tropic of Cancer and the other along the Tropic of Capricorn. Other 
	       deserts result from the effects of ocean currents on landmasses, where cool air masses 
	       carry fog and mist, but little rain, along coastal regions.

            <text>
               
               Grassland is defined as an ecosystem in which grasses, sedges, and other forage plants 
               are the dominant vegetation. Although temperate grasslands may have more than 50 species 
               of vascular plants, and tropical grasslands more than 200, two or three species of grasses 
               usually dominate upward of 60 percent of the biomass above ground.
	       <p/>
	       Grasslands are natural, seminatural, and cultivated. Natural grasslands occupy, or once 
	       occupied, large areas of continental landmasses, including the prairies and plains of 
	       North America, the pampas and paramos of South America, the veld of South Africa, and the 
	       steppes of Eurasia. Temperate natural grasslands develop in regions characterized by an 
	       annual rainfall between 250 and 750 mm (10 and 30 in), a high rate of evaporation, and 
	       seasonal and annual droughts. 
	       <p/>
	       Tropical grasslands develop in regions with marked wet and dry seasons. On the periphery 
	       of these climatic regions, fire is important in maintaining grasslands by preventing the 
	       encroachment of forests in moist regions and desert shrubs in semiarid regions.
	       <p/>
	       Seminatural grassland occupies areas where moisture is sufficient to support forests. 
	       Also called successional grassland, these areas resulted from deforestation and will 
	       return to trees unless maintained by burning, mowing, or grazing. Cultivated grasslands, 
	       such as hayfields and pastures, are artificially planted and maintained. They usually 
	       consist of one or two species of grass and a legume such as clover or alfalfa. 
	       <p/>
	       Native grasslands of the world support, or once supported, a diverse fauna. In North 
	       America, large grazing herbivores such as the bison and their large predators were 
	       dominant. Associated with such mammals are herbivorous rodents, including prairie dogs 
	       and mice; seed-eating birds; hawks; snakes; and insects, especially grasshoppers. 
	       <p/>
	       Grassland soils are inherently fertile. Due to low rainfall, soluble nutrients in the 
	       soil have not washed away, and due to the absence of a tree canopy, the flourishing 
	       grasses have built up organically rich topsoil. As a result, native grasslands of the 
	       north temperate regions have been converted to grain crops such as corn and wheat. The 
	       native grazing herbivores have been replaced by domestic cattle and sheep, and the large 
	       predators have been destroyed.

               Temperate deciduous forests are the type of forest found in the eastern United States.
	       	       
	       Forests composed of deciduous species - ones that periodically shed their leaves - grow in well-watered 
	       parts of the temperate zone in which a long, warm growing season alternates with a cold winter. 
	       Precipitation, as either rain or snow, tends to fall throughout the year.
	       
	       Deciduous trees, shrubs, and woody vines, whether in the tropics or in the middle latitudes, drop their 
	       leaves during a time of drought. For woody plants in the temperate zone, winter is such a time. In regions 
	       where the winter is so severe that the ground freezes, water cannot be taken up by the plant roots. But 
	       even in milder areas, the cold air and winter winds would quickly suck the moisture from a plant through 
	       its broad, thin leaves if they did not fall first.

	       In the spring, the forest floor is carpeted with wildflowers that bloom in the sunlight that bathes 
	       the ground before the trees and shrubs regrow their shade-casting leaves. After the long season of growth 
	       and reproduction, the changing colors of the leaves signal the beginning of the woody plants' preparation 
	       for winter. The aspect of the forest during the cold season can be quite stark, although some evergreens 
	       may offer a bit of color. In colder parts of the deciduous forest region, approaching the coniferous 
	       forests to the north, transitional mixed forests of deciduous and evergreen species are the rule.
	       
	       Temperate deciduous forests are almost entirely confined to the Northern Hemisphere, where they 
	       occur in three major tracts. In Europe, the zone of deciduous and mixed forests stretches from the 
	       British Isles and France through central and eastern Europe as far as the Ural Mountains. In East 
	       Asia, these forests clothe the Russian Far East, Korea, and Japan. Their counterparts in North America 
	       occupy most of the area from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean and south to the Gulf of Mexico. 
	       <br/>

	       <br/> 
	       Although widely separated, these deciduous forests are much alike, not only in appearance but also in the 
	       groups of plants that compose them: birches, hornbeams, alders, beeches, oaks, chestnuts, lindens, elms, 
	       walnuts, maples, and ashes.
	       
	       A long history of human occupation of these wooded regions, especially in Eurasia, has reduced many 
	       forests to tiny remnants. In parts of western Europe, millennia of forest destruction have resulted in 
	       the development of extensive areas of treeless heaths.
