      <tutorial2_welcome>
         In the following tutorial you will learn the basics of construction techniques... essentially 
         how to make a basic exhibit, change the terrain. add animals and provide paths and buildings for your guests. 
         <br>So let's get started,  click the check button on this panel to continue.</br>
      </tutorial2_welcome>
      <openconstructionpanelheading>Construction Panel</openconstructionpanelheading>
      <openconstructionpanel>
         
         
         It's time to start building! 
         
         
         <p/>
         
         
          Open the Construction Panel by clicking on the Construction button.
      
      
      </openconstructionpanel>
      <openconstructionpanelcompleted>
      	The Construction Panel is where you'll go when you want to place fences, paths, zoo buildings, scenery objects and all kinds of other
      	"man-made" objects in your zoo. Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </openconstructionpanelcompleted>
      <openfencerectangletoolheading>Fence Placement Rectangle Tool</openfencerectangletoolheading>
      <openfencerectangletool>
      	Fences are the most common way to keep your animals in... and your guests out! Click on 
      	the Rectangle Fence Placement button in the Fence Buy panel.
      </openfencerectangletool>
      <openfencerectangletoolcompleted>
      	The Rectangle Mode tool lets you easily create an enclosed habitat area. Click the check 
      	button on this panel to continue.
      </openfencerectangletoolcompleted>
      <placefencesheading>Buy Fence</placefencesheading>
      <placefences>
      	Scroll the map to find a clear spot to create a fenced area (you do remember how to scroll, right?). 
      	Select the Chain Link Fence, then click once on the ground to "anchor" the corner. Drag your mouse to see a 
      	preview of the enclosed area and click again to place it in the world. Make it large as you'll be 
      	adding a BIG animal later!</placefences>
      <placefencescompleted>
      	Great! Now you have a basic enclosure. Later you can try the Octagonal Placement Mode to make an 
      	octangonal shape or the Rubber Band Mode to place single sections. Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </placefencescompleted>
      <placegateheading>Staff Gate</placegateheading>
      <placegate>
      	Now it's time to place a gate. Select the Staff Gate and place it over the fenced area you just made. The 
      	gate preview will snap into place when your cursor is over the fence. Just click to insert the gate in that location.
      </placegate>
      <placegatecompleted>
      	You'll want to make sure that your enclosed areas have gates so your staff can get in and
      	care for the animals. Right now we're only using the Chain Link fence but there are all kinds of 
      	different fence types. The Staff Gate will automatically work on any of them. Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </placegatecompleted>
      <selectscenerytabheading>Scenery Tab</selectscenerytabheading>
      <selectscenerytab>
      	Click on the Scenery Tab to open the Scenery Buy panel. Here's where you'll find  
      	useful and decorative objects that you can place in your zoo.</selectscenerytab>
      <selectscenerytabcompleted>
      	Normally you'd see many objects on the Scenery Buy panel but for now we've 
      	narrowed it down to just one - the Donation Box. Click the check button on this panel to continue.</selectscenerytabcompleted>
      <placedonationboxheading>Donation Box</placedonationboxheading>
      <placedonationbox>
      	Select the Donation Box and move your mouse cursor over the world to see a preview of the object. When an item is on 
      	your cursor, you can rotate it by by using the &lt; &gt; keys or by clicking AND holding the left mouse button 
      	while you move the cursor around the screen. Note the green arrow pointing to it. This is the direction from which 
      	your guests will donate so make sure this side isn't blocked by something else in your zoo. Click to place the 
      	Donation Box near the fenced area you made earlier.
      </placedonationbox>
      <placedonationboxcompleted>
      	You should place a Donation Box near every exhibit... how else will your happy guests give you their 
      	money?  If guests can't find a Donation Box, their cash will stay in their pockets instead of going 
      	into yours. Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </placedonationboxcompleted>
      <selectpathtabheading>Path Tab</selectpathtabheading>
      <selectpathtab>Click on the Path Tab to open the Path Buy panel.</selectpathtab>
      <selectpathtabcompleted>
      	You'll see that there are a number of different paths that you can choose from. Guests don't so much care what 
      	type of path surface is in your zoo, but they do care that there is one! Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </selectpathtabcompleted>
      <placepathheading>Place Path</placepathheading>
      <placepath>
      	Paths work a little like fences do (you do remember placing fences, right?). Click on a path type, then click on the ground to "anchor" the path. Drag the mouse in a desired direction to see the preview of where the path will go. 
      	Click again to place it. TIP: Whenever you have an object on your cursor (in this case, a path), you can right 
      	click to clear it away.</placepath>
      <placepathcompleted>
      	You'll want to make sure that your paths lead to and provide views to your exhibits, 
      	otherwise your guests won't see your exhibits. They'll miss out on your great animals, and you'll 
      	miss out on their donations. (Yup, you'll want those paths leading to your Donation 
      	Boxes too!) Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </placepathcompleted>
      <selectbuildingtabheading>Building Tab</selectbuildingtabheading>
      <selectbuildingtab>
      	Click on the Building Tab to access the Building Buy panel... and you guessed it... this is where you'll find buildings to 
      	place in your zoo.
      </selectbuildingtab>
      <selectbuildingtabcompleted>
      	You'll find all sorts of buildings on the Building Buy panel, from food and drink stands to restrooms and 
      	more. Click the check button on this panel to continue.</selectbuildingtabcompleted>
      <placebuildingsheading>Purchase Buildings</placebuildingsheading>
      <placebuildings>
      	Now purchase a Hot Dog Food Stand, a Pretzel Cart and a Soda Drink Stand.  Click 
      	on each building, then move your mouse over the zoo to see a preview of the object. Notice the access 
      	arrow (you do remember that the arrow shows the direction the guest will access the object from, 
      	right?). Click to place the building.
      </placebuildings>
      <placebuildingscompleted>
      	Guests get hungry, thirsty, and need to use a restroom while visting your zoo. If you don't provide them 
      	with amenities to meet these needs they may leave prematurely and take their cash with them. Like exhibits and Donation Boxes, make sure that you have paths leading to all your great 
      	amenities! Click the check button on this panel to continue. </placebuildingscompleted>
      <selectpretzelcartheading>Selecting Objects</selectpretzelcartheading>
      <selectpretzelcart>
      	You can select objects that have already been placed in the world. Click on the Pretzel Cart 
      	that you just placed in your zoo to select it. (If another object is already on your cursor, you can 
      	right click to clear it.)</selectpretzelcart>
      <selectpretzelcartcompleted>
      	Great, you have the Pretzel Cart selected! Note that an information panel opens up showing the item 
      	you have selected. Don't worry about all the things on this panel for now... we'll come back to this 
      	in more detail later. Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </selectpretzelcartcompleted>
      <moveselectedentityheading>Moving Objects</moveselectedentityheading>
      <moveselectedentity>
      	Many objects can be moved to other locations (though there are some that can't be). Once you have selected an object, you can use the Pick Up 
      	Building button to "pick it up". You can also just click on the object again once it is selected. 
      	Now move the Pretzel Cart to another location.
      </moveselectedentity>
      <moveselectedentitycompleted>
      	Remember, when an item is on your cursor, you can rotate it by by using the &lt; &gt; keys or by clicking AND holding the left 
      	mouse button while you move the cursor around the screen. Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </moveselectedentitycompleted>
      <openanimalpanelheading>Adopting Animals</openanimalpanelheading>
      <openanimalpanel>
      	Click on the Animals button to open the Animal Adoption panel. This is where you'll obtain animals for 
      	your zoo.

      <placeanimalheading>Adopt animal</placeanimalheading>
      <placeanimal>
      	Select the African Elephant from the Adoption panel. Move your mouse cursor over to the fenced area that 
      	you made earlier and click to place the African Elephant inside the basic enclosure.</placeanimal>
      <placeanimalcompleted>
      	Excellent! Now you have a new animal. Guests come to see the animals so if you have no animals, you'll have 
      	no guests! Click the check button on this panel to continue.</placeanimalcompleted>
      <selectfoodtabheading>Animal Food</selectfoodtabheading>
      <selectfoodtab>
      	Select the Animal Food Tab to open the Animal Food Buy panel. If you want your animals to thrive, 
      	you'll need to make sure they have food and water.</selectfoodtab>
      <selectfoodtabcompleted>
      	All animals require food and water but they won't eat just anything (will you?). We'll tell you 
      	more about how to determine what an animal eats later but for now just click the check button on this 
      	panel to continue.
      </selectfoodtabcompleted>
      <placewaterfoodheading>Purchace Food and Water</placewaterfoodheading>
      <placewaterfood>Place a Food Trough with Hay and a Food Trough with Water near the African Elephant by clicking on the dish, then clicking inside the enclosure to place it.</placewaterfood>
      <placewaterfoodcompleted>
      	Great! Placing food and water in your exhibits will allow your animals to satisfy their hunger and thirst 
      	needs. Remember... a hungry or thirsty animal is not a happy animal! Click the check button on 
      	this panel to continue.
      </placewaterfoodcompleted>
      <selectsheltertabheading>Shelter Tab</selectsheltertabheading>
      <selectsheltertab>Select the Animal Shelters Tab to open the Animal Shelter Buy panel.</selectsheltertab>

      <researchobjectheading>Research</researchobjectheading>
      <researchobject>
      	Certain advanced objects need to be studied more carefully before you have access to them. You do this by 
      	choosing to Research the object. Objects that need to be researched are shaded green and have a small book 
      	appearing over their icon. Select the Elephant House, then press the Research button on the Object Info panel 
      	to begin research.</researchobject>
      <researchobjectcompleted>
      	It takes time and money to research an object. Once the research has been completed, the object is available for 
      	purchase. Click the check button on this panel to continue.</researchobjectcompleted>
      <placeshelterheading>Purchase Shelter</placeshelterheading>
      <placeshelter>
      	Wait for the Elephant House to complete its research. Of course you don't actually have to 'wait'... you can 
      	continue to do other things while objects are being researched. (Hey, this would be a great time for 
      	you to take a look around the zoo!). Once the research is completed, select the Elephant House and then move your cursor into your zoo 
      	to see a preview of the item. Click to place the shelter in the African Elephant's enclosure.

      	one. Purchase a Pursuit Ball for your African Elephant. Click on the object then place it in the 
      	Elephant's enclosure.
      </placeopursuitball>
      <placeopursuitballcompleted>
      	Different species of animals have different levels of interest in enrichment objects for 
      	stimulation. We'll go into more detail later about how to find out about what items
