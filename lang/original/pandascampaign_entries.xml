      <Pandasoverview>
	One of the most recognizable animals in the world, the Giant Panda is also one of the most endangered. Only 
	zoos with exceptional reputations are even considered as recipients for Giant Panda adoptions. 
	<p/>
	Due to a low reproductive rate, attempts to breed Giant Pandas in captivity often meet with 
	failure. Facilities that undertake efforts to aid in the conservation of the Giant Panda are highly 
	valued and often rely heavily on donations and grants.
	<p/>
	Create a zoo and build it to the 5-star level. If you can obtain one male Giant Panda for your zoo, you will then receive a female Panda as well as international assistance towards establishing a supportive breeding 
	environment. Play your cards right to breed two Giant Pandas and your zoo will go down in 
	history as one of the few that has successfully bred Giant Pandas in captivity.

        One of the most recognizable animals in the world, the Giant Panda is also one of the most endangered. Only

	Your exemplary Giant Panda exhibit has come to the attention of a prominent zoo in Asia. They 
	would like to send their female Giant Panda Aki Aiko to your facility on a breeding mission. Add Aki 
	to your panda exhibit and cater to her advanced needs in the hope that she will successfully give birth 
	to a baby panda. 
      </PandasSuccessPart1overview> 
      <PandasSuccessPart2overview>
	You have successfully bred Aki with your panda and have provided excellent care for Aki and her 
	baby. Aki is being returned to her zoo and they have expressed some interest in perhaps returning 
	her to your facility when her breeding cycle is again optimal. In recognition of your achievement 
	and as a sign of their appreciation for your efforts, you have been presented with a Panda Statue.
